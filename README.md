<h4 align="left">GameHub E-Commerce</h4>

###

<h5 align="left">The GameHub E.Commerce is a group project I contributed to as the final test for Henry's academy. I was responsible for and the main contributor for the Front-End. I also helped my team in the Back-End when they faced difficult problems they didn't know how to solve.</h5>
<h5 align="left">The functionalities are pretty much the basic ones of any E-Commerce, you can leave your opinion about a products after you bought it, you can add products to your wishlist or to your cart, order by price, filter per category and so on...</h5>
<h5 align="left">The cool part comes on the admin side, where you have a lot of different features that will help you manage your business. The way it works is you have 2 roles, those beings owner and admin. The admin can add products to the page, edit the price, stock and description of existing ones or delete them, ban users, unban them, promote users to have admin role, force users to a password change that comes via email and last but not least drive a purchase through it's different stages those being: pending, dispatched, received and canceled. The owner role has the same functionalities as the admin one, with the only difference that it can also demote an admin to a regular user, in case you wanna fire somebody

<h5 align="left">Countries App</h5>

###

<h5 align="left">The Countries App was my individual project for Henry's academy. It's was an Atlas of countries, to find different information about every country in the world such as population, area, continent and more...</h5>
<h5 align="left">On the details of every country you can also find popular activities in each country. In case you know about one that's not in there you can add it from the form by clicking on the "Add Activity" button that's wether on the top-left side of the homepage, or you may also find it on the details of a country, as long as it doesn't have any activities defined already. So I invite you all to colaborate and help my page turn into a more functional one by adding activities to you favourite countries and tell your friends that are going on vacation to look them up, so they don't forget what fun activities they can do wherever they're going⚽⚾🥎🏀🏐🏈🎱</h5>
